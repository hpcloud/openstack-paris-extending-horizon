# OpenStack Summit Paris, November 2014
## Extending The Pane of Glass: Building Horizon Panels for Non-OpenStack Applications

### Overview
Horizon is a great UI for managing OpenStack applications, but you can also build
integration into non-OpenStack components, providing your users with a single UI for
multiple applications. In this talk we’ll discuss the lessons learned building the
HP Helion Development Platform CloudFoundry UI, and share code for a simple panel
that manages a popular open source application.

Some topics we’ll cover include:
* development environment setup
* authentication
* using the OpenStack Dashboard code to orchestrate applications
* packaging and distributing a Horizon module
* utilizing existing OpenStack features as communications channels
* best practices for creating more complex UI interactions in Horizon

After attending this panel attendees will have a solid grasp of building Horizon
add ons, and sample code to jumpstart building their own apps!
